/* Create an object that describes a car (manufacturer, model, year of release, average speed) 
and the following methods of this object: 1) A method that displays the car info; 
2) A method for counting a time frame necessary to cover a given distance with the 
average speed (object methods can also accept parameters as regular functions). 
Note that every 4 hours the driver has to take a 1-hour break. */


/* And the tricky one :smile: Create an object that describes time (hours, minutes, seconds) 
and the following methods for if this object: 1) A method for displaying the time in format hh:mm:ss; 
2) A method for changing the time by a given amount of seconds; 3) A method for changing the time by 
a given amount of minutes; 4) A method for changing the time by a given amount of hours. 
Note that in the last three methods changing one part may influence another. For example, 
if we add 30 seconds to «20:30:45», we should get «20:31:15», not «20:30:75». */
